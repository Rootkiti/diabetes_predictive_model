# Diabetes Prediction Model
Diagnosing diabetes can be challenging, and early detection is crucial for preventing serious complications. My model aims to make the process faster and more accurate by using ML to analyze patient data and identify patterns that suggest the presence of the disease.



Data: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney.
Model: I used linear regression to identify hidden relationships within the data and learn to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
Performance: My model has achieved promising results, with an accuracy of 83% in identifying patients with diabetes.
